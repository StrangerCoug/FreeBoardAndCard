# Welcome to the FreeCasino project!
This is planned to be a free and open source cross-platform Java casino program. I am still working on the basic structure, but the following games are planned for its initial release:
1. Backgammon
2. Bridge
3. Canasta
4. Checkers
5. Chess
6. Chinese Checkers
7. Crazy Eights
8. Cribbage
9. Go
10. Hearts
11. Ninety-nine ([the trick-taking game](http://www.parlettgames.uk/oricards/ninety9.html))
12. Old Maid
13. Reversi
14. Rummy
15. Shōgi
16. Spades
17. Whist
18. Xiàngqí
I am open to adding more games over time (halma, ludo, tarot/tarock, etc.) but I think this is a good set of games to start with.

Feel free to chip in if you'd like to help!
